# Anomaly-Detection

1.A Deep Learning Project to detect security anomalies like Denial of service attacks,Probing attacks, Remote to Local (R2L) Attacks and user to root attack (U2R).

2.We use a CNN architecture to create binary classification models for an Anomaly Detection System, Here we have used a 1D Convolutional Neural Network. 

3.We use the KDD Cup 1999 Dataset.

4.For a comprehensive review of the project, refer to project report attached along with the source code.
